//Development flag file
//Normally the Arduino IDE treats the contents of the library folder as read-only. This is to prevent users from accidentally modifying example sketches. //During the library development process you may want to edit example sketches in place using the Arduino IDE. With Arduino IDE 1.6.6 and newer, the read-//only behavior can be disabled by adding a file named .development to the root of the library folder. A library.properties file must also be present. The //Library Manager indexer will not pick up releases that contain a .development file so be sure not to push this file to your remote repository.
